# BP Lazy Load Avatars #

BP Lazy Load Avatars is a small [BuddyPress](http://buddypress.org) plugin that only loads avatars if they are visible on screen.

This can considerably save unnecessary network requests and loading times when viewing a BuddyPress page.

How to use?

* Make sure BuddyPress is already activated and installed in WordPress.
* Download, install and activate this plugin.
* Navigate to any page that shows BuddyPress avatars and scroll down to see it in action.
